Query and read operations handle the <tt>404</tt> case
differently. For a read operation, a <tt>404</tt> status MUST be returned if the
resource doesn't exist. For a&nbsp;query, a <tt>200</tt> status MUST be returned with
an empty feed when the query doesn't select any resource. See
[Query Error Handling section](6.10 Query Error Handling "6.10 Query Error Handling").

When the service returns a <tt>4xx</tt> or a <tt>5xx</tt> status code, it
SHOULD include an <tt>&lt;sdata:diagnoses&gt;</tt> payload with details about
the error in its response. See
[Error Payload](3.10 Error Payload)
section for details.

When the service returns a <tt>200</tt> status code, the entry MAY include
one or more <tt>&lt;sdata:diagnosis&gt;</tt> elements. In this case, the
diagnosis elements MUST only be&nbsp;warnings or information.

SData providers MUST return errors as described above.
