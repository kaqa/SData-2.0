---

Entries returned by SData read operations can&nbsp;be cached. SData relies on the
standard HTTP caching mechanisms for this.

SData uses the same caching strategy for read operations and for queries. See
[Query Caching section](6.6 Query Caching "6.6 Query Caching") for details.

SData providers MAY implement the caching protocol described in
the [Query Caching](6.6 Query Caching "6.6 Query Caching") section.
