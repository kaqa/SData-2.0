title: 7.3 Read Caching
---

Entries returned by SData read operations can&nbsp;be cached. SData relies on the
standard HTTP caching mechanisms for this.

SData uses the same caching strategy for read operations and for queries. See
[Query Caching section](../0606/ "6.6 Query Caching") for details.

<blockquote class="compliance">SData providers MAY implement the caching protocol described in
the <a href="../0606/" title="6.6 Query Caching">Query Caching</a> section.</blockquote>
