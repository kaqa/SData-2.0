title: 2.5 Named Query URL
---

SData provides a special URL syntax for "named queries", i.e. special service
operations that implement parameterized queries. Here is typical SData named
query URL:

<pre> http://www.example.com/sdata/myApp/myContract/-/products/$queries/reorder</pre>

<table class="content" print-width="100%" width="100%">
<tbody>

<tr>

</tr>

<tr>

reorder

</td>
<td valign="top">

Query Name

</td>
<td>

This element identifies a named query

The named query may be invoked via a GET or POST request, depending on the
complexity of the parameters.&nbsp;The SData provider will return the&nbsp;results as an
Atom feed. See [Named Queries section](12 Named Queries "12 Named Queries")&nbsp;for details.

</td>

</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

The <tt>$queries</tt> component can&nbsp;be placed after the dataset segment,&nbsp;if
it applies&nbsp;to&nbsp;the entire dataset. In that case it would go&nbsp;after the hyphen in
the example URL. Or it can be placed after the
[resource kind](../0101/ "1.1 Terminology") segment,&nbsp;if it applies to resources of a specific kind as in the
example.

<blockquote class="compliance">SData providers MAY provide named queries. If they do so, they
MUST use the above URL syntax to expose their named queries.</blockquote>
