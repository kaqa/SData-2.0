SData defines a registry. This registry allows SData consumers to discover
the URLs of SData providers dynamically. It facilitates the configuration of
integration links between applications.

The registry is an SData provider that implements a special contract called
the "registry contract". This section describes the registry contract and
illustrates it with examples of how SData providers and consumers interact with
the registry. This material is covered in the following subsections:
