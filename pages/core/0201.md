title: "2.1  Resource Collection URL"
---

Let's start with a typical SData URL for a resource collection:

<pre>[http://www.example.com/sdata/myApp/myContract/prod/accounts?startIndex=21&amp;count=10](http://sdata.acme.com/sdata/myApp/myContract/prod/accounts?startIndex=21&amp;count=10) 
</pre>

This URL has the following components:

<table class="content">
<tbody>

<tr>

<th valign="top">

<th valign="top">

**Component Name**

<tt>https </tt>is also allowed.

<td valign="top">

[www.example.com](http://www.example.com)

</td>
<td valign="top">

Server name

</td>
<td>

IP address is also allowed (<tt>192.168.1.1</tt>).

Can be followed by port number. For example
<tt>[www.example<tt>.c</tt>](http://www.example.com:5493/)</tt>[<tt>om:5493</tt>.](http://www.example.com:5493)

5493 is the recommended port number for SData services that are not exposed
on the Internet.

Contract name

</td>

An SData service can support several “integration contracts” side-by-side.
For example, a typical Sage ERP service will support a <tt>crmErp</tt> contract
which exposes the resources required by CRM integration (with schemas imposed by
the CRM/ERP contract) and a <tt>native</tt> or <tt>default</tt> contract which
exposes all the resources of the ERP in their native format.

Dataset

</td>
<td>

Identifies the dataset when the application gives access to several datasets,
such as several companies and&nbsp;production/test datasets.

If the application can only handle a single dataset, or if it can be
configured with a default dataset, a hyphen can be used as a placeholder for the
default dataset. For example, if prod is the default dataset in the example
above, the URL could be shortened as:

<tt>[http://www.example.com/sdata/myApp/myContract/-/accounts?startIndex=21&amp;count=10](http://www.example.com/sdata/myApp/myContract/-/accounts?startIndex=21&amp;count=10)</tt>

If several parameters are required to specify the dataset (for example
database name and company id), they should be formatted as a single&nbsp;segment in
the URL. For example, <tt>myApp/myContract/demodb;acme/accounts</tt> -- the
semicolon separator is application specific, not imposed by SData.

</tr>

</td>
<td valign="top">

Resource Kind

</td>
<td>

This URL segment identifies the kind of resource that is&nbsp;queried
(<tt>account</tt>, <tt>contact</tt>, <tt>salesOrder</tt>, etc.)

This URL returns the collection of all account resources, as an Atom feed.

If the contract exposes a large number of [resources
kinds](1.1 Terminology "1.1 Terminology"), a functional group can be inserted before the resource kind
segment&nbsp;(eventually a hierarchy of functional groups), which&nbsp;act as a folder (a
hierarchy of folders) to organize the resources.

Typical functional groups would be <tt>financials</tt>,
<tt>commercials</tt>, <tt>HR</tt>, etc.

Query parameters

</td>
<td>

The <tt>startIndex</tt> and <tt>count</tt> parameters allow the service
consumer to request a specific page in a collection. See
[paging section](6.4 Query Paging "6.4 Query Paging") and [query
parameters section](2.11 Query Parameters "2.11  Query Parameters") for details.

SData URLs MUST comply with this structure. The components
listed in the table above MUST be present, unless the URL is an intermediate URL
(see [Intermediate URLs](2.9 Intermediate URLs "2.9 Intermediate URLs") section) and they MUST be in
the right order. There is nevertheless a tolerance on the <tt>/sdata</tt>
virtual directory component. Applications MAY use a different virtual directory
name or MAY have more than one segment before the application name if their
deployment infrastructure requires it. Such applications SHOULD NOT expose a
$system URL (see [System and Registry URL](2.8 System and Registry URL "2.8  System and Registry URL") section) as
the <tt>$system</tt> component MUST be in the <tt>/sdata</tt> virtual directory.
