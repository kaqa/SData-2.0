title: 12 Named Queries
---

Named queries are a special form of service operations that are pervasive
enough to deserve a special treatement in SData.

This section starts with an [example of named query](../1201/ "12.1 Example of Named Query").

The following subsections describe different aspects of queries:

*   [Named Query URL](../1202/ "12.2 Named Query URL")

*   [Named Query metadata ](../1203/ "12.3 Named Query Metadata")

*   [Named Query template ](../1204/ "12.4 Named Query Template")

*   [Error handling ](../1205/ "12.5 Named Query Error Handling")
