title: 12 Named Queries
---

Named queries are a special form of service operations that are pervasive
enough to deserve a special treatement in SData.

This section starts with an [example of named
query](/daisy/sdata/596-DSY/591-DSY.html "12.1 Example of Named Query").

The following subsections describe different aspects of queries:

*   [Named Query URL](12.2 Named Query URL "12.2 Named Query URL")

*   [Named Query metadata ](12.3 Named Query Metadata "12.3 Named Query Metadata")

*   [Named Query template ](12.4 Named Query Template "12.4 Named Query Template")

*   [Error handling ](12.5 Named Query Error Handling "12.5 Named Query Error Handling")
