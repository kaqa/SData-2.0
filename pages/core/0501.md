title: 5.1 Encryption

SData relies on [HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Https) for
encryption. For example:

<pre>https://www.example.com/sdata/myApp/myContract/-/customers</pre>

Most business applications contain sensitive data. To protect this data from
potential spies on the network, it should be encrypted. SData does not introduce
any specific encryption mechanism but relies on HTTPS, the well-known secure
variant of HTTP, to encrypt communications.

HTTPS needs a certificate&nbsp;installed on the provider side. If the SData site
is meant for&nbsp;public viewing&nbsp;on the Internet, the certificate must be purchased
from a reputable vendor such as&nbsp;Verisign or Thawte and renewed regularly. This
is costly and complex to administer for small businesses.

On the other hand, if the SData site is for private or semi-private use,
HTTPS can be used with free certificates.

<blockquote class="compliance">SData providers SHOULD use HTTPS to secure sensitive data over
the Internet.</blockquote>
