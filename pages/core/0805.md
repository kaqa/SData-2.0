An asynchronous POST was accepted.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or is in progress if this is a tracking
request.

A <tt>Location</tt> header with the tracking URL MUST be returned.

The payload MUST be an <tt>&lt;sdata:tracking&gt;</tt> payload. See [Tracking Payload](http://interop.sage.com/daisy/sdata/SDataProtocolDescription/AnatomyOfAnSDataFeed/TrackingPayload.html) section.

Conflict](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.10)

</td>
<td valign="top">

The resource cannot be created because of a conflict with existing resources.
For example a violation on a unique index.

If the service uses universally unique identifiers (UUIDs) generated by the
consumer,&nbsp;it SHOULD NOT return a <tt>409</tt> error if it receives the same UUID
twice. Instead, it SHOULD return a <tt>201</tt> success code. See note below.

<td valign="top">

[500
Internal Server Error](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.5.1)

<td valign="top">

Serious provider error. Client SHOULD NOT&nbsp; retry the request.

[503
Service Unavailable](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.5.4)

</td>
<td valign="top">

Transient provider error. Client MAY retry the request.

The provider SHOULD include a <tt>Retry-After</tt> header in its response to
indicate when&nbsp;the consumer MAY retry the request.

</td>

</table>

When the service returns a <tt>4xx</tt> or a <tt>5xx</tt> status code, it
SHOULD include an <tt>&lt;sdata:diagnoses&gt;</tt> payload with details about
the error in its response. See
[Error Payload](3.10 Error Payload)
section for details.

If the service handles reliable POSTing at the application level
(with UUIDs inside the payload, see [Reliable Posting
section](8.4 Reliable Posting "8.4 Reliable Posting")), it SHOULD return the success response (<tt>201</tt> status +
<tt>Location</tt> + <tt>&lt;entry&gt;</tt>). If it receives a <tt>POST</tt> for
an existing UUID on a resource that has been created but never modified, it
SHOULD ignore the posted entry and return the entry as read from its data store.
This&nbsp;guarantees&nbsp;the request is idempotent (safe to be called several times) from
the consumer side.

SData providers MUST return errors as described above.
