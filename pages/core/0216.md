SData URLs may contain non ASCII characters. A typical example is a query
like:

> [http://www.example.com/sdata/myApp/myContract/prod/accounts?where=name eq 'le roi du béton'](http://sdata.acme.com/sdata/myApp/myContract/prod/accounts?startIndex=21&amp;count=10)

This URL is invalid because the é letter is not an ASCII character. SData
uses the following encoding to pass non ASCII characters in URLs:

*   The character is converted to its UTF-8 representation. For the é letter,
this is a 2 byte hexadecimal sequence: C3 A9
*   Each byte of the UTF-8 representation is "percent encoded". So the é letter
becomes %C3%A9

The correct representation for the example URL is then:

> [http://www.example.com/sdata/myApp/myContract/prod/accounts?where=name eq 'le roi du b%C3%A9ton'](http://sdata.acme.com/sdata/myApp/myContract/prod/accounts?startIndex=21&amp;count=10)

<blockquote class="note">The "like" operator uses the percent sign as wildcard character.
As the percent sign is used to escape special characters it must be escaped and
passed as %25 (% is an ASCII character, so its UTF-8 representation is just its
ASCII value, 25 in hexadecimal notation).</blockquote>

<blockquote class="compliance">SData providers and consumers MUST use the encoding described
above to pass non ASCII characters in URLs

URLs that are embedded in XML payloads returned by the provider (for example
<tt>href</tt> values for links) MUST be percent encoded by the provider so that
the consumer can use them directly.

Similarly, URLs that are embedded in XML payloads posted by a consumer MUST be
percent encoded on the consumer side prior to posting.</blockquote>
