title: 13 Batch Operations
---

SData supports a batch mode for CRUD operations. In this mode, several
operations are submitted together as a single batch request.

This mode supports processes that import, update or delete a large number of
resources. It's also used by the SData synchronization protocol.

The following subsections describe different aspects of the SData batching
protocol:

*   [Batching URL](../1301/ "13.1 Batch URL")

*   [Metadata](../1302/ "13.2 Metadata Extension for Batching")

*   [Synchronous request](../1303/ "13.3 Synchronous Batch Request")

*   [Batch response](../1304/ "13.4 Batch Response")

*   [Asynchronous operations](../1305/ "13.5 Asynchronous Batch Operations")

*   [Error handling](../1306/ "13.6 Batch Error Handling")
