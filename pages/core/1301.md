title: 13.1 Batch URL
---

The URL for a batch operation is obtained by appending <tt>/$batch</tt> to
the [resource kind](../0101/ "1.1 Terminology") URL. For example:

<pre>http://www.example.com/sdata/myApp/myContract/-/accounts/$batch</pre>

A consumer should use this URL to POST a batch of operations on accounts.

<blockquote class="compliance">SData providers MAY support batching. They MUST support the
<tt>$batch</tt> URL on all resource kinds that have the
<tt>sme:batchingMode</tt> flag set to a value other than <tt>none</tt>.</blockquote>
