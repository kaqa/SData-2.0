SData supports query operations on resource kinds. Queries return feeds
containing resource entries.

This section starts with an [example of an SData query](../0601/ "6.1 Query Example").

The following subsections describe different aspects of the querying
protocol:

*   [Filtering](../0602/ "6.2 Query Filtering")

*   [Sorting](../0603/ "6.3 Query Sorting")

*   [Paging](../0604/ "6.4 Query Paging")

*   [Payload control](../0605/ "6.5 Query Payload Control") (depth and breadth of information returned in every entry)

*   [Caching](../0606/ "6.6 Query Caching")

*   [Rendering](../0607/ "6.7 Feed Rendering")

*   [Querying property URLs](../0608/ "6.8 Query on Property URL")

*   [Querying intermediate URLs](../0609/ "6.9 Query on Intermediate URL")
