title: 2.7  Resource Schema URL
---

Every contract MUST have an associated schema that describes the XML payloads
for the resources and service operations exposed by the service. So, every
contract MUST have a <tt>$schema</tt> URL such as:

<pre>http://www.example.com/sdata/myApp/myContract/-/$schema</pre>

<table class="content" print-width="100%" width="100%">
<tbody>

<tr>

<th>

Example

</th>
<th>

Component Name

</th>
<th>

Description / Comments

</th>

</tr>

<tr>

<td valign="top">

$schema

</td>
<td valign="top">

Schema keyword

</td>
<td>

Special syntax to designate a schema

</td>

</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

This URL returns the schema for the <tt>test</tt> contract in
[XSD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Schema) format.

The&nbsp;service MUST also support a <tt>$schema</tt> URL on every
[resource kind](../0101/ "1.1 Terminology"). For example, accounts and contacts
feeds will have links to the following schema URLs:

<pre>http://www.example.com/sdata/myApp/myContract/-/accounts/$schema?version=1.0.7
http://www.example.com/sdata/myApp/myContract/-/contacts/$schema?version=1.0.7</pre>

<blockquote class="note">Schema links MAY include a <tt>version</tt> parameter. This
enables consumers to cache them more efficiently. See
<a href="../0214/" title="2.14 Resource Versioning">Resource Versioning section</a> for details.</blockquote>

These last URLs SHOULD redirect to fragments in the contract schema. For
example, the <tt>accounts/$schema</tt> URL above should return the following
redirection response:

<pre>302 Found
Location: http://www.example.com/sdata/myApp/myContract/-/$schema?version=1.0.7#account
Expires: Thu, 06 Aug 2009 16:00:00 GMT</pre>

To get the account resource definition, the service consumer should query the
global schema (<tt>test/$schema?version=1.0.7</tt>) and search for an element
definition&nbsp;with id&nbsp;<tt>account</tt> inside the global schema.

The SData service SHOULD set the HTTP caching headers appropriately to allow
service consumers to cache schemas. See [Resource
Versioning section](../0214/ "2.14 Resource Versioning")&nbsp;and&nbsp;[Caching section](../0606/ "6.6 Query Caching").

If a schema imports or includes schema fragments, the schema fragments SHOULD
be exposed as sub-resources of their primary $schema resource (see
[Importing and including schemas](../0411/ "4.11 Importing and including schemas")). A typical fragment
URL will be:

<pre>http://www.example.com/sdata/myApp/myContract/-/$schema/common</pre>

<blockquote class="compliance">SData providers MUST support $schema URLs at the contract and
resource kind level, as described above.</blockquote>
