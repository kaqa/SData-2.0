## REST-style Web Services

SData is a
[REST-style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer)
web services protocol. The main characteristics of the REST approach are:

*   Application data is exposed as resources
*   Resources are addressed via URLs
*   CRUD operations are mapped to HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
*   Errors are reported as standard HTTP status codes.
*   Functionalities like caching, paging, concurrency handling, asynchronous
operations, etc. take advantage of HTTP features whenever possible.

REST-style web services is a whole topic in itself and deserves a lot more
than such a short enumeration. People who are curious about REST and who would
like to dig into the design philosophy behind SData are encouraged to read the&nbsp;
"[RESTful Web Services](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529260)"
book by Leonard Richardson and Sam Ruby.

## External Standards

SData leverages existing web standards whenever possible. The following table
gives a list of the standards upon which SData is built:

## Postel's Law

This wiki describes the SData protocol in a style that mixes informal
examples and more formal protocol specifications. The formal material does not
cover all possible cases, as this would have led to a very heavy document. There
is nevertheless a very important principle that underlies SData's design and
that implementors should follow when they encounter a situation not or
incompletely described in the wiki:

> _Be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you receive_

This principle is known as
[Postel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Postel)'s Law. It is a
fundamental principle that underlies the design of many protocols.

The practical implications of this principle for implementors of SData
providers are the following:

*   SData providers should be tolerant (liberal) in the way they process
requests received from SData consumers. For example, if some header is missing
(<tt>Content-Type</tt> for example), the provider can usually infer the value of
this header from the request (for example <tt>application/atom+xml;
type=entry</tt> if the request is a POST to a resource kind URL). Then the
provider should accept the request and process it instead of returning an error.
The provider may nevertheless include a warning in its response to inform the
consumer that some protocol element was missing from the request.
*   SData providers should be strict (conservative) in the way they format their
responses to SData consumers. For example, providers should systematically
include the right <tt>Content-Type</tt> header in all the responses that they
produce.

Postel's law also applies to SData consumers, but we cannot assume that all
SData consumers will strictly follow all the rules. This is why it is important
that SData providers follow Postel's rule. This maximizes interoperability, even
with consumers that do not handle all the subtleties of the protocol.

This does not mean that SData providers should never return
errors. They should be tolerant as long as there is no real ambiguity or
incoherence in the request. If, for example, the consumer sends a PUT request
for a resource that does not exist, the provider should return a <tt>404 Not
Found</tt> error, it should not treat the PUT as a POST and create a new
resource.
