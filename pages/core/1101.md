title: 11.1 Overview of Service Operations
---

Service operations are operations that don't fit naturally into the REST
(resource / CRUD) mould. Here are some examples:

*   A <tt>computeSimplePrice</tt> function that takes a (<tt>productId</tt>,
<tt>customerId</tt>, <tt>quantity</tt>) combination as input and produces a
(<tt>unitPrice</tt>, <tt>quantityPrice</tt>, <tt>discount</tt>, <tt>tax</tt>)
combination as output.

*   A <tt>computeOrderPrices</tt> function that takes a richer input. For
example,&nbsp;where sales order&nbsp;in one application calls another application to
request values, such as prices and discounts.

*   A <tt>manufactureOrder</tt> call that takes an order ID as input and causes
the ERP to start the manufacturing process for the order.

*   A <tt>sendOverdueReminders</tt> call that causes the ERP to find customers
with overdue invoices and email them a reminder.

SData uses a SOAP-like approach for service operations. Service&nbsp;operations
are executed via an HTTP <tt>POST</tt> but SData uses a different envelope to
package the&nbsp;raw&nbsp;XML data. The SOAP envelope is replaced by an Atom envelope,
entry or feed depending on whether the operation manipulates a single entry or a
collection of entries.

SData supports asynchronous operations. If the operation needs to return a
result synchronously, it should be executed as a single HTTP request&nbsp;with the
result in the HTTP response.&nbsp;For example,&nbsp;<tt>computeSimplePrice.</tt> This is
only possible if the call completes quickly because the consumer would&nbsp;timeout
otherwise. Whereas&nbsp;if the caller doesn't need to get the result synchronously,
and&nbsp;the call&nbsp;takes time to complete on the provider side, it should execute
asynchronously.&nbsp;The caller&nbsp;has a standard way to interrogate the service and
monitor the progress of the operation. For example, sendOverdueReminders.&nbsp;

SData could take advantage of more HTTP features. In particular,
operations that do not have side effects could be executed via a <tt>GET</tt>
rather than a <tt>POST</tt> and the parameters could be passed as URL query
parameters. But this would make the protocol more complex for little benefit.&nbsp;At
least in this initial version, SData imposes the <tt>POST</tt> method for all
service operations.

SData providers MAY expose any number of service operations
(including none). SData providers that expose service operations MUST use the
protocol described in the following pages.
