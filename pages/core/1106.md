title: 11.6 Reliable Posting of Service Operation
---

The SData protocol guarantees [reliable Posting](8.4 Reliable Posting "8.4 Reliable Posting") on
asynchronous operations. It forces the consumer to allocate a universally unique
identifier (UUID)&nbsp;and passes it via the <tt>trackingID</tt> parameter. Thanks to
this UUID, the service provider can detect duplicate requests and reject them.

There is only one issue&nbsp;here. If the provider receives a duplicate
<tt>POST</tt> for a given <tt>trackingID</tt>, it SHOULD return its normal
<tt>202</tt> response, not a <tt>4xx</tt> error. This&nbsp;guarantees the request
is&nbsp;idempotent (safe to be called several times) from the consumer side.
