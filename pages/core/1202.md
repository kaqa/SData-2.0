title: 12.2 Named Query URL
---

Named query URLs are obtained by appending a <tt>$queries </tt>segment and a
query name to an SData
[resource kind](../0101/ "1.1 Terminology") URL, as described in&nbsp;the corresponding [URL syntax subsection](../0205/ "2.5 Named Query URL").

Typically, our example query would be available at the following URLs:

<pre>http://www.example.com/sdata/myApp/myContract/-/products/$queries/reorder </pre>

Named queries MAY use the same query parameters as normal queries for paging,
filtering, sorting, controlling payload, etc. The features supported by a given
named query MUST be advertised in the schema with <tt>sme:canXxx</tt>
attributes.

Some of these parameters (<tt>where</tt>, <tt>orderBy</tt>,
<tt>include</tt>, <tt>select</tt>) need to reference payload properties (for
example <tt>orderBy=price</tt>). The expressions that reference properties MUST
ignore the <tt>&lt;response&gt;</tt> element which is present in the payload.
For example, the correct syntax is <tt>orderBy=productId</tt>, not
<tt>orderBy=response.productId</tt>.

<a href="../0205/" title="2.5 Named Query URL">Named Query URL</a> section to expose their named
queries.</blockquote>
