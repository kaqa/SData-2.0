title: 13.5 Asynchronous Batch Operations
---

SData supports asynchronous batch operations.

The schema MUST indicate if batching is supported in synchronous or
asynchronous mode or in both modes, by means of the
<tt>[sme:batching](../1302/ "13.2 Metadata Extension for Batching")</tt>[attribute](../1302/ "13.2 Metadata Extension for Batching").

The protocol is similar to the one used for
[asynchronous service operations](../1105/ "11.5 Asynchronous Operations").

A batch can be submitted asynchronously by adding a <tt>trackingID</tt>
parameter&nbsp;to the URL. For example:

<pre>http://www.example.com/sdata/myApp/myContract/-/accounts/$batch?trackingID=abc42b0d-d110-4f5c-ac79-d3aa11bd20cb</pre>

The asynchronous execution&nbsp;acts as a normal
[asynchronous service request](../1105/ "11.5 Asynchronous Operations"). The provider would&nbsp;send
a response such as:

<pre>202 Accepted
Location: http://www.example.com/sdata/myApp/myContract/-/accounts/$batch?trackingID=abc42b0d-d110-4f5c-ac79-d3aa11bd20cb&nbsp;

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;tracking xmlns="http://schemas.sage.com/sdata/2008"&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;phase&gt;Initialization&lt;/phase&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;phaseDetail&gt;Starting thread&lt;/phaseDetail&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;progress&gt;0.0&lt;/progress&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;elapsedSeconds&gt;0&lt;/elapsedSeconds&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;remainingSeconds&gt;7&lt;/remainingSeconds&gt;
  &lt;pollingMillis&gt;500&lt;/pollingMillis&gt;
&lt;/tracking&gt;</pre>

The consumer can track the progress of the operation by sending a
<tt>GET</tt> request on the tracking URL (<tt>Location</tt> HTTP header in the
response above):

<pre>GET /sdata/myApp/myContract/-/accounts/$batch?trackingID=abc42b0d-d110-4f5c-ac79-d3aa11bd20cb</pre>

The provider&nbsp;responds with a <tt>202 Accepted</tt> status as long as the
operation is&nbsp;in progress. When the batch has been completely processed, the
provider&nbsp;sends the normal <tt>200 OK</tt> response with the response feed
described in the [section 13.4 Batch Responses](../1304/ "13.4 Batch Response").

The consumer MUST NOT forget to delete the batch resource by sending:

<pre>DELETE /sdata/myApp/myContract/-/accounts/$batch?trackingID=abc42b0d-d110-4f5c-ac79-d3aa11bd20cb</pre>

<blockquote class="note">The asynchronous mode doesn't just help with performance, it
also provides <a href="../1106/" title="11.6 Reliable Posting of Service Operation">reliable posting</a> because the presence
of the <tt>trackingID</tt> parameter should make the <tt>POST</tt> operation
idempotent (safe to be called several times). The provider should never create
two batch jobs with the same <tt>trackingID</tt>.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="compliance">SData providers MAY support the asynchronous mode for batch
operations. If this mode is supported, the provider MUST use the protocol
described above.</blockquote>
