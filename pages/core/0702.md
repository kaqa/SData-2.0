SData provides three parameters to control the payload attached to the entry:
<tt>precedence</tt>, <tt>include</tt> and <tt>select</tt>. These parameters work
like in queries. See [Query Payload Control](6.5 Query Payload Control "6.5 Query Payload Control") section
for details.

Conformant SData providers MUST support the three mechanisms
described in the [Query Payload Control](6.5 Query Payload Control "6.5 Query Payload Control") section
