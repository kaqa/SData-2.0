title: 2.9 Intermediate URLs
---

URLs are hierarchical by nature.&nbsp;Previous pages describe terminal URLs that
correspond to resource collections, resources, service operations, schemas, etc.
Terminal&nbsp;URLs are the primary URLs that an SData consumer&nbsp;uses to interact with
a provider. But a consumer may also try to access intermediate URLs such as:

<pre class="coffeescript">http://www.example.com/sdata
http://www.example.com/sdata/myApp
http://www.example.com/sdata/myApp/myContract
http://www.example.com/sdata/myApp/myContract/prod
http://www.example.com/sdata/myApp/myContract/prod/$service
http://www.example.com/sdata/myApp/myContract/prod/accounts/$service
http://www.example.com/sdata/myApp/myContract/prod/accounts/$queries</pre>

An SData provider SHOULD support <tt>GET</tt> operations on these URLs. If
so, it MUST respond with an Atom&nbsp;feed that lists&nbsp;the branches available at the
intermediate level of the URL hierarchy. The entries of the returned feed SHOULD
be tagged with Atom categories so that the consumer can find out if the entries
describe collection URLs, single resource URLs, service operation URLs, etc.

The following table gives an overview of the feeds returned by these
intermediate URLs, as well as the categories that the provider should use to tag
the feed and its entries (see [SData Scheme section](../0312/ "3.12 SData Category Scheme")):

<blockquote class="compliance">SData providers SHOULD support these URLs. There may
nevertherless be constraints that prevent them from implementing the topmost
intermediate URLs. For example, in a Tomcat deployment, it is likely that every
contract will be handled by a different servlet. Then, the contract servlet
should be able to list the datasets but there will not be any servlet to list
the contracts. In this scenario, intermediate URLs will only be supported at the
contract level and below.</blockquote>
