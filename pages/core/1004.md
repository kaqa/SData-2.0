When the service returns a <tt>4xx</tt> or a <tt>5xx</tt> status code, it
SHOULD include an <tt>&lt;sdata:diagnoses&gt;</tt> payload with details about
the error in its response. Except in the <tt>412</tt> case where it returns an
<tt>&lt;entry&gt;</tt> and in the <tt>410</tt> case which is considered as a
success&nbsp;for the delete operation.&nbsp; See
[Error Payload](3.10 Error Payload)
section for details.

SData providers MUST return errors as described above
