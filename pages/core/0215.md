Applications MAY extend the SData URL syntax with application specific URL
branches (similar to $service, $schema or $template) or application specific
query parameters.

To avoid potential conflicts between application specific extensions and
future extensions to the SData protocol, applications SHOULD prefix all their
extensions with an underscore (_).

The following table gives&nbsp;examples of application specific extensions:

<table class="content" print-width="100%" width="100%">
<tbody>

<tr>

<th>

URL

</th>
<th>

Description

</th>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>

<a href="http://www.example.com/sdata/myApp/myContract/-/contacts/_deleted">http://www.example.com/sdata/myApp/myContract/-/contacts/_deleted</a>

</td>
<td>

Application specific Extension to query resources that have been "soft
deleted".

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>

<a href="http://www.example.com/sdata/sageApp/text/-/contacts('254')?_transaction=23">http://www.example.com/sdata/myApp/myContract/-/contacts('254')?_transaction=23</a>

</td>
<td>

Application specific extension to pass a transaction context to a query.

</td>

</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

Development teams are encouraged to submit their extensions to the SData
working group. Extensions that have general applicability may become part of&nbsp;a
future version of the standard (they will then loose their underscore).
