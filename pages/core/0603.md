title: 6.3 Query Sorting
---

## URL

The sorting criteria MUST be passed via the
<tt>orderBy</tt>[ query parameter](../0211/ "2.11  Query Parameters"). For example:

<pre>GET /sdata/myApp/myContract/-/salesOrders?orderBy=orderDate desc</pre>

The orderBy parameter MAY list several criteria separated by commas. For
example, orders can be sorted by descending date and then by ascending order id
with the following query:

<pre>GET /sdata/myApp/myContract/-/salesOrders?orderBy=orderDate desc,orderId asc</pre>

## Metadata

In the schema, the properties that can be used to sort SHOULD be flagged with
the [<tt>canSort</tt> attribute](../0403/ "4.3 Property Definition"). For example:

<pre>&lt;xs:element name="orderDate"&nbsp;type="xs:date"
            sme:label="Date"&nbsp;sme:canSort="true"&nbsp;sme:canFilter="true"&nbsp;sme:precedence="2" /&gt;</pre>

<blockquote class="compliance">SData providers MUST support sorting on all the properties
flagged with <tt>sme:canSort="true"</tt>.

SData providers SHOULD support multiple criteria, but there MAY be restrictions
in this area. The list of keys may be constrained to match the columns of a
database index for example. This should be advertised via documentation in the
schema, as there are no SME attributes for these constraints.

If the provider cannot handle the combination of criteria specified by the
consumer, it SHOULD NOT return an error. Instead, it SHOULD apply the subset of
criteria that it can handle and it SHOULD add a &lt;diagnosis&gt; element to the
response feed, with a warning describing what it could not handle.</blockquote>
