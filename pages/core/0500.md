Business applications contain sensitive data and SData must guarantee that
this data is accessed in a secure way. It must&nbsp;honour the access control
policies that have been defined in the applications. The following subsections
describe how SData addresses fundamental security requirements:

*   [Encryption&nbsp; ](../0501/ "5.1 Encryption")

*   [Authentication](../0502/ "5.2 Authentication")

*   [Single Sign-On](../0503/ "5.3 Single Sign-On")

Other security topics, such as Access Control List (ACL) are under
investigation.
