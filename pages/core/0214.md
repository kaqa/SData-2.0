title: 2.14 Resource Versioning
---

SData provides a URL syntax to refer to&nbsp;a specific "version" of a resource.
This syntax is most often used in schema URLs. For example:

<pre>http://www.example.com/sdata/myApp/myContract/-/$schema?version=1.0.7</pre>

This URL&nbsp;returns a specific version of the schema, while a URL without a
version returns the current version of the schema.

As a general rule, versioned resources MUST have two important properties:

*   The versions SHOULD have a reasonable life time. Previous versions should be
kept&nbsp;when the resource is modified. This should not be too strict though and
SData does not require that versions be kept forever, they may be purged from
time to time.
*   Versions MUST be unchangeable. If the consumer requests the same version
twice, he should get the same response.

As versions are unchangeable, the provider MUST set the <tt>Expires</tt>
HTTP header to the end of the expected lifetime of the version when serving
<tt>GET</tt> requests that include a <tt>version</tt> parameter. For example a
<tt>GET</tt> on the example URL&nbsp;would return a response:

<pre>200 OK
Content-Type: application/xml
Expires: Thu, 06 Aug 2009 16:00:00 GMT

&lt;xs:schema xmlns:tns="http://schemas.sage.com/myContract" 
           targetNamespace="http://schemas.sage.com/myContract" 
           xmlns:sme="http://schemas.sage.com/sdata/sme/2007" 
           xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"&gt;
...</pre>

The HTTP recommendation is to set the date to one year in the future to
indicate an infinite lifespan

Versioning is encouraged on schema resources because it allows consumers to
cache schemas efficiently. It also enables providers to ensure consistency
between data and metadata. When the feed and its schema are retrieved
separately, there is&nbsp;always a risk of mismatch. This risk goes away&nbsp;if&nbsp;the
schema URL includes a <tt>version</tt> parameter.

The <tt>version</tt> parameter MAY also be applied to application resources
but this feature requires that the application keep history trails (payroll
applications often do this). The application MUST guarantee that versioned
resources have a reasonable lifetime and that their versions are unchangeable.

<blockquote class="compliance">SData providers MAY support resource versioning. If they do,
they MUST use the version parameter and follow the above rules</blockquote>
