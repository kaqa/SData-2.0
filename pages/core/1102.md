Service URLs are obtained by appending a <tt>$service</tt> segment and a
service operation name to an SData [resource kind](1.1 Terminology "1.1 Terminology")
URL, as described in&nbsp;[the corresponding URL syntax
subsection](2.4 Service Operation URL "2.4  Service Operation URL").

Typically, our example operations would be available at the following URLs:

<pre>http://www.example.com/sdata/myApp/myContract/-/products/$service/computeSimplePrice 
http://www.example.com/sdata/myApp/myContract/-/salesOrders/$service/computeOrderPrices 
http://www.example.com/sdata/myApp/myContract/-/salesOrders/$service/manufactureOrder 
http://www.example.com/sdata/myApp/myContract/-/customers/$service/sendOverdueReminders </pre>

SData providers MUST use the URL syntax described in
the&nbsp;[Service Operation URL](2.4 Service Operation URL "2.4  Service Operation URL")&nbsp;section to expose their
service operations.
