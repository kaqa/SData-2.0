title: 10.3 Delete on Property URL
---

SData supports delete operations on property URLs, to delete a child of an
existing resource. For example, the following request deletes an order line of a
sales order:

<pre class="http">DELETE /sdata/myApp/myContract/-/salesOrders('43661')/lines('3')
If-Match: 2nXz9DZYR2pqmcXi/ZCbYA==</pre>

If the operation succeeds, the service provider sends a response such as:

<pre class="http">200 OK</pre>

This feature is restricted to properties that represent parent/child
relationships (properties marked with <tt>sme:relationship="child"</tt> in the
schema).

Relationship properties that support this feature MUST be flagged with
<tt>canDelete="true"</tt> in the schema.

<blockquote class="compliance">SData providers MAY support delete operations on property URLs.
They MUST support them on all the properties that are flagged with
<tt>sme:canDelete="true"</tt> in the schema.</blockquote>
