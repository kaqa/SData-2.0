## <a name="embedded-engine" href="#embedded-engine">Embedded Engine</a>

The deployment can be simplified by embedding the engine into one of the
endpoints. In this case, the communications between the engine and its embedding
endpoint can be short-circuited (they are not required to go through HTTP and
URLs). For example, if the engine is run from the source application and if the
source also handles the diagnostics, the diagram becomes:

![sync archi 2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/img/sync archi 2.png "sync archi 2.png")

In this simplified architecture the source is not a service provider any
more, it has become an application that consumes services exposed by another
application.

If bi-directional synchronization is needed between the two applications, we
can still use the same simplified architecture. To synchronize in the other
direction, the diagram becomes:

![sync archi 3.png]({{site.baseurl}}/img/sync archi 3.png "sync archi 3.png")

The simplified architecture for bi-directional synchronization is then:

![sync archi 4.png]({{site.baseurl}}/img/sync archi 5.png "sync archi 4.png")

## <a name="sattelite-engine" href="#sattelite-engine">Satellite Engine</a>

The following architecture variant is also possible:

![sync archi 5.png]({{site.baseurl}}/img/sync archi 5.png "sync archi 5.png")

This last diagram shows an architecture suitable for disconnected clients:
Application A runs on a laptop with a local data store. It uses the SData
synchroniation protocol to catch up with the server (Provider B) when a
connection is available. As the engine is stateless and the algorithm fully
distributed, each laptop can run its own synchronization engine.

## <a name="other-scenarios" href="#other-scenarios">Other Deployment Scenarios</a>

The “simplification exercise” above shows that SData synchronization can
accommodate both a “suite” scenario where a central engine coordinates
synchronization passes between services and a “disconnected laptop” scenario
where each laptop runs its own sync engine.

But the architecture allows a lot more variants because all the interactions
go through URLs and the location of the components does not matter much (all
that is required is that the engine can access the other component's URLs).
Flexibility is particularly important on the error reporting side, and nothing
prevents the engine from sending the diagnoses to more than one diag endpoint.
In the context of an application suite, this is usually not required because the
suite has a central event management facilty, but when the applications do not
belong to a suite, SData allows the system to be configured to report errors in
one of the applications, or in the other, or in both, or sometimes in one
sometimes in the other (depending on the direction for example). This decision
should be dictated by product considerations and the SData architecture should
be able to accommodate the various needs of our product integration scenarios.
