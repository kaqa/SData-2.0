The engine may be given one or more logging URL. If so, it should post the
result of the batch operation to the logging URL(s).

The logging component will analyze the
<tt>&lt;httpStatus&gt;</tt>,&nbsp;<tt>&lt;httpMessage&gt;</tt> and
<tt>&lt;diagnosis&gt;</tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;elements of the batch entries and will log according
to the logging policy that has been configured.

If the results of the target side operations need to be sent back to the
source application, the source provider should expose a <tt>$syncResults</tt>
URL (see [Synchronization URLs](../0401/ "4.1 Synchronization URLs") section)&nbsp;and the
engine should POST the results to this URL. In our example, the following POST
request will be executed:

<pre class="http">POST /sdata/myApp1/myContract/-/accounts/$syncResults?runName=Full%20CRM%20to%20ERP&amp;runStamp=2009-10-14T08:51:02 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type:&nbsp;application/atom+xml; type=feed

&lt;!-- Batch result obtained from the target (see <a href="../0503/" title="5.3 Updating Synchronization Target">Updating Synchronization Target</a> section) --&gt;</pre>

The source provider will record the results of the batch&nbsp;and send a success
response:

<pre>200 OK</pre>
