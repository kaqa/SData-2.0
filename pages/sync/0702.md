## <a name="internal-vs-adapter" href="#internal-vs-adapter">Internal vs. Adapter</a>

Two approaches may be used to implement the synchronization endpoints:

*   Internal implementation: the synchronization metadata (digest, record level
info) is stored in the application tables and the application takes complete
responsibility for the implementation of the endpoint.

*   Adapter: the synchronization metadata is managed by an adapter library rather
than by the application itself. The synchronization metadata is stored in
separate tables. These tables may reside in the same database as the application
tables (recommended option to be robust with respect to backup/restore
operations), or in a separate database (fall back option). The adapter handles
the SData sync protocol and the endpoint synchronization logic. It interacts
with the application through a small number of interfaces that read and write
resources.

The following diagram shows the structure of an endpoint implemented with the
adapter approach:

![sync adapter]({{site.baseurl}}/img/sync adapter.png "sync adapter")

The internal solution allows the application to implement the SData
synchronization protocol in an optimal way. As the application controls
everything, it can optimize the storage and the algorithms.

The adapter alternative gives less control on the application side but
relieves the application from implementing the synchronization logic. This
approach allow applications to support the SData synchronization protocol with a
minimal implementation effort (implementing the adapter interface is much
simpler than implementing the whole SData sync protocol).

Despite the extra effort that it requires, the internal solution has some
advantages and should be considered for framework-based applications. The
adapter alternative is probably the right path for applications that are not
structured around a strong framework.

## <a name="adapter-interface" href="#adapter-interface">Adapter Interfaces</a>

This section gives a very simplified specification of the adapter interface.
This is by no means an "industrial" specification, just a preliminary prototype
to explain how the responsibilities will be split between the application and
the adapter.

The heart of the adapter interfaces will be a pair of interfaces like the
following:

<pre>public&nbsp;interface&nbsp;ISyncSource
{
  IEnumerable&lt;IResourceHead&gt; ScanResources(string oldToken, out&nbsp;string newToken);
  XmlNode[] ReadResources(string[] localID);
}

public&nbsp;interface&nbsp;ISyncTarget
{
  IResourceHead[] GetResourceHeads(string[] localIDs);
  IBatchResult ProcessBatch(IBatch batch);
}</pre>

The ISyncSoure interface is called by the adapter when it receives a request
on its $syncSource URL. It allows the adapter to scan the application table for
changes (ScanResources method) and then obtain the XML payload for the
synchronization entries (ReadResources method).

The ISyncTarget interface is called by the adapter when it receives a request
on its $syncTarget URL. It allows the adapter to detect and handle conflicts and
then pass the batch of changes to the application for processing (the changes go
through the application's business logic layer before being written to the
database).

If the application only supports unidirectional synchronization on some of
its resources, it only needs to implement one of these interfaces.

## <a name="resource-head" href="#resource-head">Resource Head</a>

The ScanResources method does not return the whole data for the changes, it
only returns a small piece of heading information for every resource. This
heading corresponds to the following C# interface:

<pre>public&nbsp;interface&nbsp;IResourceHead
{
  string LocalID { get; }
  string ETag { get; }
  DateTime ModifiedStamp { get; }
}</pre>

These properties should be set as follows by the application:

<table class="content">
<tbody>

<tr>

<th>

Property

</th>
<th>

Value

</th>
<th>

Comment

</th>

</tr>

<tr>

<td valign="top">

LocalID

</td>
<td valign="top">

Primary key value for the resource

</td>
<td valign="top"></td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td valign="top">

ETag

</td>
<td valign="top">

ETag value for the resource

</td>
<td>

The adapter uses this information to decide if the resource has changed or
not.

If the application does not keep track of any version information (internal
tick, modified stamp), it should compute a checksum on the resource data and
return it as ETag.

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td valign="top">

ModifiedStamp

</td>
<td valign="top">

Timestamp of last modification

</td>
<td valign="top">

The adapter uses this information because the SData protocol requires it for
conflict detection.

If the application does not keep track of any the modification stamps, it
should return the current timestamp (the conflict handling rule will be misled
but this is the best we can do in this case).

</td>

</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

## <a name="token" href="#token">Token</a>

The adapter takes full responsibility for the synchronization metadata:
digest and resource-level sync data. When the adapter is used, the application
does not see the synchronization "ticks" any more (they are delt with at the
adapter level). On the other hand, the application may have some way of
identifying the ressources that have changed: a timestamp, an internal tick, an
offset in a transaction log, etc. This information is managed as a "token" by
the adapter. If the application does not have any internal mechanism to track
changes, the adapter will still work but will be less efficient: the token will
always be empty and the adapter will have no choice but do a full table scan
every time it processes a request on its $syncSource URL.

So, the token is a piece of information that the application logic
understands and that it uses to query changes efficiently. From the adapter and
the SData protocol standpoint, the token is an opaque piece of data that is
passed around (it is included in digest entries) but that is never interpreted
in any way outside of the application.

## <a name="adapter-tables" href="#adapter-tables">Adapter Tables</a>

The adapter maintains two tables:

*   The Digest table in which it keeps track of the digest entries.

*   The ResSync table in which it keeps track of the resource-level
synchronization data (endpoint id + tick).

The Digest table has the following columns:

<table class="content">

## <a name="syncdigest-processing" href="#syncdigest-processing">$syncDigest Processing</a>

The adapter processes this request by reading its Digest table. There is no
interaction with the application during this request.

## <a name="syncsource-processing" href="#syncsource-processing">$syncSource Processing</a>

When the adapter receives a request on its $syncSource URL, it processes it
as follows:

*   First, it brings its ResSync table up to date. For this, it goes throught the
following steps:

*   It gets the token for the local entry of the request's digest.

*   It calls the ScanResources method of the ISyncSource interface, passing the
token as first parameter.

*   It processes the ressource headings returned by the call. For each one, it
compares the ETag value with the value in the corresponding record of its
ResSync table. If the ETag values differ, its sets the tick to the current local
tick of its digest table and it updates the ModifiedStamp of the ResSync record.*   Then, it generates the SData response to the $syncSource request:

## <a name="synctarget-processing" href="#synctarget-processing">$syncTarget Processing</a>

When the adapter receives a request on its $syncTarget URL, it processes it
as follows:

*   First, it performs conflict detection. The steps are the following:

*   It gets the local ids for the batch entries from its ResSync table.

*   It calls the GetResourceHeads method of the ISyncTarget interface to get the
resource headings from the application

*   For each resource heading, it compares the ETag value with the value in the
corresponding record of its ResSync table. If the ETag values differ, its sets
the tick to the current local tick of its digest table and it updates the
ModifiedStamp of the ResSync record.

*   It applies the SData conflict detection rules, using the information from its
Digest and ResSync tables.*   Then it updates the resources in the application:

## <a name="other-interfaces" href="#other-interfaces">Other Interfaces</a>

The adapter will need other interfaces to integrate fully into the
application's environment. For example, if the application wants the Digest and
ResSync tables to be stored in its database, it will need to provide an
additional interface that the adapter will use to obtain a connection to the
application database.

Also, the implementation described needs to be refined to handle deleted
records (when necessary). If the application does not manage any tombstone data,
this may involve a full scan of the application table.

## <a name="adapter-summary" href="#adapter-summary">Adapter Summary</a>

The endpoint adapter is a library that handles the SData synchronization
protocol on behalf on an application. The adapter reduces the implementation
work on the application side. The application will need to provide a small
number of methods that the adapter will call to query modified resources, get
resource headings and apply a batch of changes. The adapter will deal with all
the nitty-gritty details of the synchronization protocol.
