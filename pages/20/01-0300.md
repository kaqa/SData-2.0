title: SData 2.0 maintains compatibility of existing solutions
---

SData 2.0 is no longer a 'green field' solution - it emerges in a setting where a substantial number of solutions are already present. Although SData is primarily forward looking, it should avoid forcing existing products to embark on a forced-change route without a well-founded reason.

The SData 2.0 features were carefully considered from the compatibility angle. It was the specific desire of the working group to deliver the message:

> *"Your SData 1.x compliant implementation is automatically compliant to SData 2.0"*

To achieve this, we restricted ourselves to:

*  relaxing existing rules by changing the compliance qualifier from MUST or SHOULD to MAY to increase the level of optionality
*  making new features optional
*  deprecating (not disallowing) outdated solution
