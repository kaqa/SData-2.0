title: 2 Using Sage ID with SData
---

Sage ID provides support for the authorization code grant type described in RFC 6749, "The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework" [3]. A client participating in this protocol receives a "bearer token" which is 
presented to a service as evidence of authorization. The way that the bearer token is transferred 
between the client and the service is defined in RFC 6750, "The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework: 
Bearer Token Usage" [4].

The Bearer Token Specification does not specify the contents of the token (this is intentionally left to be 
implementation specific), but it does specify the mechanisms for presenting access tokens in resource 
requests.

There are three main mechanisms for presenting access tokens:

*  [HTTP request header](../06-0201/)
*  [HTTP request entity-body](../06-0202/)
*  [HTTP URI query parameter](../../core/0211/ "2.11 Query Parameters")

Only the first of these mechanisms is supported by the SData 2.0 Protocol.
