SData Links are JSON objects that provide the information necessary to operate on a resource. [5](#5)

SData Links also convey the operational capabilities on a resource.  If links are provided for the creation 
of a resource, the operation-related specifications like canPost (see the SData 1.1 standard, [sme.xsd](../../core/AppendixA/ "Appendix A: sme.xsd")) become redundant.  Other capabilities (like canFilter for example) are gathered in the $capabilities metadata element.

This chapter describes in turn:

*  The standard SData links; these cover the CRUD operations on a resource.
*  The components of an SData link.
*  The links to services and queries related to a resource.

The usage of links and the definition of a $links object is OPTIONAL.

<a name="5">5</a>. SData Links are a specific embodiment of Roy Fielding's hypermedia controls (enabling "Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State" or HATEOAS); Fielding's indication to REST application designers is that operations (state transfer) be driven by hypertext. Link constructs (as known from HTML and ATOM) appear to be an appropriate means to do this.
