title: A note to SData ATOM+xml users
---

If you are intimately aware of the ATOM+xml format of SData as described in the [SData 1.x standard](../../core/0100/ "1 Introduction"), you 
will have noticed that some ATOM mandated elements are not present in the JSON objects of this 
document. The reason is that these are meaningful in a syndication context but have little relevance in 
the general SData application. The elements omitted are:

*  Envelope markup <feed> : no longer needed due to representation as a JSON object 
*  Envelope markup <entry> : no longer needed due to representation as a JSON object
*  &lt;id&gt; : information is carried by the $url element
*  &lt;link rel='self'&gt; : information is carried by the $url element
*  &lt;author&gt;
*  &lt;category&gt;
