This paper describes the JSON format for SData content. The focus is placed on the structural aspects of 
content and representation of the protocol-mandated information. The details of metadata usage are 
handled in a separate document.

The document is aimed at a technical audience who has had a prior exposure to the SData protocol. 

The information in this document has not been approved by the standard body governing SData. As 
such, it should be treated as a preview and a snapshot to the upcoming JSON aspect in SData.
