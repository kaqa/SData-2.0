title: 10 SData prototypes
---

Prototypes play a role roughly corresponding to schemas in SData v1.1; the advantage is that they are 
expressed as SData JSON objects and are more flexible and compact than XML Schema Definition
documents. Prototypes define the native and metadata properties of a resource kind, specifying the 
corresponding types and, for metadata, the default values.

The following subsections introduce the SData prototypes by:

*  describing the format and function of the $prototype object,
*  indicating how a $prototype object can surface in a response,
*  showing how prototypes can be retrieved individually.

A prototype is a resource that bundles the metadata of a resource kind representation.  If metadata is 
provided, the usage of prototypes in the JSON context is **strongly RECOMMENDED** but **not mandatory**.
