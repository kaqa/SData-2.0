title: Formatting native objects in JSON
---

Representing a native data container in JSON is a straightforward task, guided by the following rules:

*  Scalar properties and their values are represented as JSON name-value pairs
*  Structural elements and sub-objects are represented as JSON objects
*  Collections are represented as JSON arrays

### <a name="expressing-simple-data-object">Expressing a simple data object in JSON</a>
Let us consider a simplified SalesOrderLine object of the following structure and values:

*  productName -> "iPad"
*  productID  -> 437
*  lineNumber  -> 1
*  orderedQuantity -> 2
*  unitPrice  -> 399.95

We note that the object contains scalar properties that translate easily into JSON name-value pairs. Thus, 
the JSON representation would be:

<pre>
{ 
    "productName" : "iPad", 
    "productID" : "437",
    "lineNumber" : 1,
    "orderedQuantity" : 2, 
    "unitPrice" : 399.95
}
</pre>


### <a name="expressing-data-object">Expressing a data object with embedded structures in JSON</a>

Let us alter the example above by grouping the product-related properties in an own structure:

*  product
    *  name    -> "iPad"
    *  ID     -> "437"
*  lineNumber    -> 1
*  orderedQuantity -> 2
*  unitPrice    -> 399.95

In this case, the product structure would be represented as a JSON object in its own right. Thus, the JSON 
representation is:

<pre>
{
    "product" : { 
        "productName" : "iPad", 
        "productID"  : "437" 
    },
    "lineNumber" : 1,
    "orderedQuantity" : 2, 
    "unitPrice" : 399.95
}
</pre>


### <a name="expressing-object">Expressing an object with an embedded collection</a>

A usual example of an object containing a collection of data elements is the SalesOrder. It contains a 
collection of line items for the individual positions in the order itself. A simplified SalesOrder structure is: 

*  orderDate
*  shipDate
*  contact
    *  firstName  -> "John"
    *  lastName   -> "Doe"
    *  email    -> "john.doe@acme.com"
*  orderLines - containing
    *  lineNumber  -> 1
    *  orderedQuantity -> 2
    *  unitPrice  -> 399.95
    *  product
    *  name  -> "iPad"
    *  ID   -> 437   
    *and*
    *  lineNumber  -> 2
    *  orderedQuantity -> 1
    *  unitPrice  -> 323.00
    *  product
    *  name  -> "Samsung Galaxy S2"
    *  ID   -> 932
    *  subtotal   -> 1021.95
    
In the translation we observe the following:

*  orderDate, shipDate and subtotal are scalar properties that should be represented as JSON 
name-value pairs
*  contact is a structural element, and therefore to be represented as a JSON object. The contact 
properties firstName, lastName and email are scalar properties expressed as name-value JSON 
pairs
*  orderLines is a collection, and should be represented as a JSON array. The array elements, the 
individual line items are structural elements translating into JSON objects.
*  product is a structural element, mapping to a JSON object
*  All remaining properties are scalar, hence representable as name-value JSON pairs.

The resulting JSON representation is:

<pre class="json">
{
    "orderDate" : "2001-07-01" , 
    "shippedDate" : null, 
    "contact" : {
        "firstName" : "John", 
        "lastName"  : "Doe", 
        "email"  : "john.doe@acme.com"
    }, // end contact
    "orderLines" : 
        [ {
            "lineNumber"  : 1,
            "orderedQuantity" : 2, 
            "unitPrice"  : 399.95,
            "product" : { 
                "name" : "iPad", 
                "ID"  : "437"
            } //end product
          }, {
            "lineNumber"  : 2,
            "orderedQuantity" : 1, 
            "unitPrice"  : 323.00,
            "product" : { 
                "name" : "Samsung Galaxy S2", 
                "ID"  : "932"
            } //end product
          } 
        ], // end orderLines
    "subtotal" : 1021.95
}
</pre>
