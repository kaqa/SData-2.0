title: 7  SData JSON Types
---

The type of an SData JSON property or object is defined by its associated $type property.  The possible 
values of the $type property follow the MIME type formalism; the process of registering the "sdata/"
prefix with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is underway.  The types are presented in the 
following sub-sections, divided into basic and complex types.

The approach of defining explicit SData basic types for date, time and datetime (rather than 
representing these types as SData string types with associated formats) was taken in the interests of 
familiarity to application designers and programmers.
