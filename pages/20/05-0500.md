title: Conventions for metadata

In SData, metadata elements and payload properties may co-exist in the same JSON object. In order to 
distinguish between the payload and metadata properties, SData requires that metadata elements have 
names prefixed by a dollar sign ('**$**'). SData-defined metadata elements are presented in Appendix A.

A metadata property with a value of null is ignored.

All complete examples in this document are presented in gray boxes. These complete examples are all 
valid JSON documents.  The convention of a property name of "&hellip;" with a property vaue of "&hellip;" is 
used to indicate that some detail which is not relevant to the topic being explained has been omitted.
