title: What makes a 'good' contract
---

SData is in effect composed of a small core of requirements and a wide number of artifacts and 
mechanisms that may be adopted in order to provide viable, re-usable solutions with a lot of 
commonality. 

The contract turns the SData 'may' into the set of 'must' that delivers a solution. A contract should 
therefore be **clear**, **precise** and **detailed**. Having said that, we will temper it by adding: &hellip; but in the 
amount that the (potential) adopters of the contract require. 
Given the high variance (ex: from business partner to internal development teams) in the skills and 
needs of the audience, there is no absolute manner to assess the quality of a contract: 'good' is 
relative. 

Along the same lines, the documents that describe the contract are difficult to pinpoint. Some team 
work better using technical formalisms such as schemas or UML diagrams, while others prefer prose 
descriptions of the functionality. Again, orienting oneself on the target audience will help choose the 
right artifacts to define a contract.
