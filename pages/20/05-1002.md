title: 10.2  Prototypes exposed by an application&colon; the $prototypes URL segment
---

The prototypes of an application are SData JSON resources retrievable by a GET operation.  The URL segments of a prototype are formed according to the pattern:

&hellip;/$prototypes/[&lt;*resourceKindName*&gt;[('&lt;*prototypeId*&gt;')]] where:

*  $prototypes: is a reserved segment located at the resource kind level [8](#8).  This MUST be 
supported if prototype resources are present. 
*  *resourceKindName*: is the name of the resource whose prototype it is.  This SHOULD be 
supported if at least one prototype is available for a resource kind.
*  *prototypeId*:  MAY be present.  It is the identifier for the prototype and relates to the 
representation of a resource [9](#9). 

***
<a name="8">8</a>. For more information, see the discussion in the SData URL chapter of the "SData 2.0 - Core" document   
<a name="9">9</a>. It is important to note that there <u>may</u> be several prototypes associated with a single resource kind. For example, an application could distinguish between information delivered for a feed of a resource kind, that of an individual entry and yet again to that of a resource at creation.
