title: What is an SData contract
---

In its wider meaning, a contract is an (usually binding) understanding between consenting parties. 
The points agreed are documented in textual form and kept for reference. The important bit is the 
understanding; the documentation and formalism thereof will vary from contract to contract. 

An SData contract is to be viewed as a mutual understanding described by documentation that 
specifies the functional, logical and structural semantics of an SData interface. The contract is a 
fundamental component, occupying (usually) one of the first segments of the SData URL.

A contract:

*  solves a business requirement and is purpose directed. Any application can provide multiple
contracts in order to satisfy varying, independent and specific requirements

*  uses those SData features deemed appropriate to express the functional aspects of a 
solution

*  uses services from non SData providers as necessary for achieving its business goal

*  is **implemented** by an application through the provision on the application's side of an SData 
interface that conforms to the requirements of the contract

As such, a contract:

*  should specify adherence to the syntactic and semantic rules of a specific SData release (i.e. 
support of SData 1.0, 1.1 or 2.0)

*  should define which optional aspects of SData are supported and in what context

*  Should describe the interaction:
    *  with a single application (typical in a client-server scenario)
	*  between several applications (deeper application integration)
*  may span a **set of documents of varying types**. Even if a schema (xsd) is one such document, 
it is not by necessity the embodiment of the contract; as a note: the presence of a schema is 
<u>not mandatory</u> in a contract and in SData 2.0, it will also no longer be a MUST.
*  may impose additional constraints on the usage of SData, (eg: support of specific SData 
artifacts, constraining URL structure,...) 
*  cannot relax or ignore the SData protocol requirements (MUST items in SData) 

The following diagram shows that a contract chooses from a variety of services and SData artifacts to 
achieve its goals:

The diagram above presents the major components of a contract: 

*  the services and formalisms used (in this case SData, Google and MaxMind) 
*  the resources and their operations. It is important to note that the customers resource 
supports only a subset of the SData verbs (DELETE is missing), a subset of query parameters and 
only one SData mechanism, the paging. External services are used for graphing and geo-location.

A contract will usually fall in one of the following two categories:

*  domain contract, defining the interactions with applications of a business domain. This is the 
case with the GCRM contract
*  native contract, defining an application-specific interface. This is the case with products like 
Sage50, OfficeLine, X3 and many others

In most cases, a contract documents an API. Therefore, also in most cases, a good API 
documentation would be a well-defined contract.

### <a name="examples">Examples</a>

One of the best known examples of a contract is the global CRM (GCRM) integration contract. It 
provides a common definition of services to be leveraged by CRM applications when integrating with 
ERP applications. The contract describes:

* a (very large) subset of SData 1.1 to be supported by providers
* the underlying structures and services by means of a schema
*  the synchronization mechanism support
*  [additional documentation](#) for inter-application workflows

Another example is the mobile-device contract of the German OfficeLine. This exposes a functionally 
slim and narrow API designed specifically to serve mobile OfficeLine client apps. What makes this 
contract interesting is the fact that it is very purpose directed (mobile clients and not a generalpurpose API), that it resides alongside other contracts and is application specific.
