SData 1.x discusses authorization aspects in the security section ([5 Security](../../core/0500/ "5 Security")) of the standard. **These 
remain valid in SData 2.0.**

SData 2.0 will provide means to integrate with SageID and will specify the needed support for single sign 
on. The relevant documents are currently under development.
