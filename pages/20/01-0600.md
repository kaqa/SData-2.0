title: SData derives value from reuse
---

The advantage of the toolkit positioning is the flexibility it puts in the hands of delivery teams to select 
and implement those features deemed necessary for a solution. This promotes the creation of lean, 
purpose-directed solutions for the most varying use-cases.

As the number of SData-based implementations increase, value is derived from the technological 
foundation (HTTP, REST), and further, from the re-use of tried-and-tested mechanisms present in the 
standard. 

The SData community is encouraged to exchange white papers, architectural approaches, extensions 
(when the standard is insufficient) and even components that emerge in the development process. To 
underpin the community aspect, the standard will be complemented with a knowledge repository 
allowing teams and individuals to find and benefit from the experiences of other community members.
