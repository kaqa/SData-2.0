In previous SData versions, the role and contents of a contract was not clearly specified. Our initial
belief was that the intuitive understanding of the term would lead to consistent result; 
unfortunately, this assumption was in some cases wrong, causing discussions and delays.

SData 2.0 allows more freedom of implementation than any the previous releases. Many previously 
required aspects of the standard become optional; in addition, there is a choice between the formats
(atom+xml or json) used to represent the information exchanged between provider and consumer. In 
this new setting, it is more than ever necessary to clearly define the components of a businessoriented solution - a duty to be fulfilled by the contract. 

In order to clear previous misunderstandings and guide future developments, this document 
provides a more precise description of the SData contract concept.
