Any internet media type outside the ones described in the previous sections MAY be attached to an 
SData JSON property.  The associated value (or object) in the payload is transparent to SData, although it 
could be meaningful in the context of a particular contract. 

Note: if a JSON object is specified using "application/JSON", there is no requirement for the attached
JSON object to conform to the SData standard.

Example:   An Employee resource referencing a photograph resource could be represented as follows:

<pre>
{
    "$baseUrl": "http://www.example.com/sdata/MyApp/-/-",
    "...": "...",
    "$properties": {
        "firstName": {
            "$type": "sdata/string"
        },
        "lastName": {
            "$type": "sdata/string"
        },
        "photoKey": {
            "$type": "sdata/string",
            "$isHidden": true
        },
        "photograph": {
            "$type": "image/jpeg",
            "$url": "{$baseUrl}/pictures('{photoKey}')"
        }
    },
    "...": "...",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "photoKey": "445-C...",
    "photograph": "http://www.example.com/sdata/MyApp/-/-/pictures('445-C...')"
}
</pre>

In the example above, the consumer would be able to retrieve the image associated with an employee 
by combining the information from the photograph object with the information passed in the payload 
through the photoKey property.

The $isHidden property indicates that the photoKey property SHOULD NOT be rendered on any user 
interface.
