When sending the access request token in the Authorization header, the access token must be base64 
encoded and preceded by the literal string "Bearer" (without the quotation marks):

<pre>
GET /resource HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com
Authorization: Bearer vF9dft4qmT
</pre>

## 2.1.1  Server Response

When an SData service receives a request via any of these mechanisms, it should:

*  Base 64 decode the token
*  Decrypt the decoded token using the service symmetric key (previously supplied when the service was registered with Sage ID)
*  Validate the token according to the procedure illustrated in the Sage ID documentation and sample code

If token validation succeeds and the request is authorized, the service should fulfill the request.
