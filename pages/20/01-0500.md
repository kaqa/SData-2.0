title: SData implementations rely on contracts
---

If SData is about choice, real-life implementations are about precision. From its beginnings, SData viewed 
contracts as the conceptual backbone of implementations; their role is to select the appropriate services 
and mechanisms whose combination delivers a practical business solution.

Under the impression that the concept of a contract requires no further clarification, the standard had 
omitted a clear definition - leaving room for misunderstanding.

SData continues to see contracts as the cornerstone of solutions. Version 2.0 describes the role and 
importance of contracts clearing the most common misconceptions that accompanied this concept up to 
date.

SData contracts can select from the variety of services and SData formalisms those features deemed 
necessary to achieve their goal. Contracts clearly state these choices and are free to impose more 
stringent rules do adopters than required by SData.
