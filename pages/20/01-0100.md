SData, now a few years old, is actively used by a number of teams across Sage. Since its release, there 
were a significant number of successfully delivered SData projects - just as there were some setbacks. 
Learning from past experiences, both positive and negative, we set to re-work the SData standard in the 
light of its fundamental role: to deliver the underlying protocol for Sage applications seeking web 
enablement and integration.
 
This paper outlines aspects considered by the SData working group to be fundamental for the version 2.0 
of the standard.
