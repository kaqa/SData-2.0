title: SData provides technological choice
---

SData 2.0 is about choice. The most visible choice is the one between the xml-based ATOM format and 
the JSON format. This is a fundamental change to SData and an opportunity to confidently enter the 
arena of modern, web-based applications.

The JSON format allows SData to operate outside the strictures of the ATOM protocol - originally 
designed for news syndication. SData expands from the tools and formalisms present in the xml world, 
to the lighter and more dynamic world of JavaScript consumers. In this context, SData provides the 
structures necessary for efficient and flexible JSON-based processing. It should be noted however that 
not every JSON feature is immediately available in the xml format as well: metadata handling primitives 
and flexible replacements for XSD-based schemas are initially available on the JSON side only. The 
standard will close this gap in time.

On a wider scale, SData has only few requirements (HTTP, a few payload formatting aspects, some 
special syntax) but provides a variety of solutions to choose from: querying, paging, batching, reliable 
post, metadata handling and more. The latter is the wider - yet optional - offering of the SData 2.0 
toolkit.
