This paper designates and describes the central aspects of SData, yielding the 'core' of the specification. 
The document does <u>not</u> contain the <u>official text</u> of the core itself - it points out the fundamentals, leaving
the global community presentation of the topics open for future work.

This document will:

*  Identify the SData 2.0 fundamental aspects and establish the relation to their counterparts in the 1.x version of the standard
*  Re-define compliance levels(MUST/SHOULD/MAY) on core aspects
*  Deprecate outdated features or solutions
