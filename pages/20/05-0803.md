title: 8.3 Service and query links

Links are used to express services and queries delivered by a provider, as defined in the SData 
specification [section 11](../../core/1100/ "11 Service Operations") and [section 12](../../core/1200/ "12 Named Queries").  In this case, the name of the link object corresponds to the desired query/service. 

Examples:  The following is the link accessing the createBOM service returning the bill of materials 
associated with a sales order. 

<pre>
{
    "$links": {
        "createBOM": {
            "$title": "Create Bill of Materials",
            "$url": "{$url}/$service/createBOM",
            "$method": "POST",
            "$response": "{$baseUrl}/$prototypes/createBOM",
            "$invocation": "syncOrAsync"
        }
    }
}
</pre>

In addition to the URL and appropriate HTTP method, the link indicates the structure of the response (by 
means of a prototype which is discussed later in this document) as well as the fact that the server may 
choose whether the service is to be performed in a synchronous or an asynchronous manner.

The following is an example showing an SData query associated with a Products resource kind (described 
in the SData documentation Example of Named Query):

<pre>
{
    "$links": {
        "reOrder": {
            "$title": "List of products to be reordered",
            "$url": "{$url}/$queries/reorder",
            "$method": "GET",
            "$request": {
                "$properties": {
                    "family": {
                        "$title": "product category",
                        "$type": "sdata/string"
                    },
                    "threshold": {
                        "$title": "minimal in-stock threshold",
                        "$type": "sdata/integer"
                    }
                }
            },
            "$response": {
                "$type": "sdata/array",
                "$item": {
                    "$properties": {
                        "productID": {
                            "$title": "Product ID",
                            "$type": "sdata/string"
                        },
                        "description": {
                            "$title": "Description",
                            "$type": "sdata/string"
                        },
                        "inStock": {
                            "$title": "Quantity in stock",
                            "$type": "sdata/integer"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>

The reOrder named query provides a list of products with stock below a certain threshold value. The 
specification of the query contains the $request object that contains a description of the two 
parameters accepted by the query, namely family and threshold. It also describes the structure of 
the return with the three properties: productID, description and inStock.
