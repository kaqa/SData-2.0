When designing distributed systems, there is always a balance to be struck between flexibility and 
simplicity. One particular instance of this balance is in the amount of "hard-coded" or built-in knowledge 
that a client, or consumer, should have about the server, or provider, that it is using[&sup1;](#1). Historically, 
consumers have been designed with significant amounts of built-in knowledge about the provider, 
tipping the balance in favour of simplicity and against flexibility. In this situation the provider needs only 
to provide raw information, as knowledge necessary to handle this raw information is encoded into the 
client. Increasingly, however, we are building more versatile clients, capable of communicating with 
several different providers and able to adapt, dynamically, to data and metadata from any given 
provider.

SData 2.0 is focused on supporting these more versatile clients and treats the representation, transport, 
and handling of metadata as an important protocol element. This document defines how SData 
providers should expose JSON metadata at the feed, entry and property level.
