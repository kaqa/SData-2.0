<blockquote class="compliance"> Compliance requirements 
A provider SHOULD consider metadata support in its payloads. This has the advantage of supporting for 
more dynamic/flexible clients that usually rely on metadata to interact with users. However, if the 
particular use case does not require metadata and its support would burden the development effort, a 
provider need not implement it.

If metadata is supported, the provider MAY choose to support [prototypes](../05-1000/ "10 SData prototypes") but MUST support [embedded metadata](../05-0400/ "4 Requesting metadata"). 

If a prototype for the targeted resource exists, the provider MUST return it in the payload for a GET 
request with the '?includePrototype=true' specification; if no prototype exists, the specification has 
no effect.

The amount of metadata returned is a provider specific decision. A reasonable expectation is that, if 
prototypes are supported, the embedded metadata would consist only of overrides to the prototype.

A consumer MAY leverage the metadata existent in a response. If it does so then, <u>unless otherwise 
specified in the underlying contract</u>:

*  If a prototype exists, then this MUST be retrieved and the [merge process](../05-1004/ "10.4 Merge process") MUST be applied.
*  The [substitution process](../05-0600/ "6 Substitution formalism") MUST be applied.
