# Welcome ! 

This repository provides technical information on the version 2.0, 1.1 and synchronization of the standard.

SData is a web toolkit, promoting the development of REST-orientated
          services and their consumption. It consists of a small,
          standards-based core (HTTP, ATOM, JSON) and a set of
          optional mechanisms solving common implementation challenges in a
          consistent manner.

The version 2.0 of the standard delivers
          additions aimed towards the needs of web product- and interface
          definitions. The focal points of the new release are:

*   Specification of the JSON format for SData information exchanges
*   Relaxation of several SData restrictions,
            resulting in a smaller, better-defined specification core
*   Compatibility with the SData 1.1 version, ensuring that
            SData 1.1 implementations are automatically version 2.0 compliant
*   Clarification of the role and form of contracts
*   Reorganization of the standard, stressing the freedom of choice
            for development teams and architects


Included in the site are older but still valid specifications:

* Vesion 1.1 of the standard is the basis on which the current version (2.0) is built. The focus is on ATOM+xml and REST as applicable primarily for integrating applications. The specification contained herein maintains its validity in the context of the 2.0 release.  
* SData Sync describes the synchronization protocol underlying compliant applications.
