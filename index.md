# Welcome ! 

This repository provides technical information on the version 2.0 of the standard.

SData is a web toolkit, promoting the development of REST-orientated
          services and their consumption. It consists of a small,
          standards-based core (HTTP, ATOM, JSON) and a set of
          optional mechanisms solving common implementation challenges in a
          consistent manner.

The version 2.0 of the standard delivers
          additions aimed towards the needs of web product- and interface
          definitions. The focal points of the new release are:

*   Specification of the JSON format for SData information exchanges
*   Relaxation of several SData restrictions,
            resulting in a smaller, better-defined specification core
*   Compatibility with the SData 1.1 version, ensuring that
            SData 1.1 implementations are automatically version 2.0 compliant
*   Clarification of the role and form of contracts
*   Reorganization of the standard, stressing the freedom of choice
            for development teams and architects

        The documents contained in our GitHub file repository form the complete technical core of standard's 2.0 release. They are to be
        viewed in conjunction with the version 1.1, expanding and ammending the [SData 1.1 specification](http://interop.sage.com/daisy/sdata/Introduction.html). The following documents describe SData 2.0 (click on the links to download directly):

*   [Approach](https://github.com/Sage/SData-2.0/blob/master/SData%202.0%20approach%20-%20v%20101.pdf?raw=true):    	  The SData 2.0 approach document presents a number of key statements and goals that guide the current development of the standard
*   [Contracts](https://github.com/Sage/SData-2.0/blob/master/SData%202.0%20-%20contracts%20v%20101.pdf?raw=true):
            The Contracts document describes the concept of an SData contract, an area not clearly presented in the current version of the standard. It shows the role of contracts, describes the many shapes they may take and finishes by outlining some items that could be considered by contract designers.
*   [Core](https://github.com/Sage/SData-2.0/blob/master/SData%202.0%20Core%20-%20v%20101.pdf?raw=true):
            The Core document outlines the essential components of SData 2.0 and describes the differences to the 1.1 version of the standard.
*   [JSON Formatted responses](https://github.com/Sage/SData-2.0/blob/master/JSON%20formatted%20SData%20responses%20-%20v101.pdf?raw=true):
            The document describes the various aspects relating to the integration of JSON in SData. It covers the response JSON formatting as well as the mechanisms used to request JSON from a provider.
*   [Expressing metadata in JSON](https://github.com/Sage/SData-2.0/blob/master/SData%202%200%20Expressing%20metadata%20in%20JSON%20-%20v1.pdf?raw=true):
            The document describes how metadata surfaces in SData JSON responses. It defines the set of SData-recognized structural elements such as types and links as well as the manner in which metadata surfaces in SData JSON responses. The document also introduces prototypes, the JSON parallel to schemas.
*   [SageID integration](https://github.com/Sage/SData-2.0/blob/master/SData%202%200%20Sage%20ID%20Integration.pdf?raw=true):
            The document outlines how SData 2.0 compliant providers interact with the SageID authentication provider.

The documents are hosted at [https://github.com/Sage/SData-2.0](https://github.com/Sage/SData-2.0), our file repository. We welcome your visit!

		The next step in our efforts is a complete rework of the SData site and its contents. The final product will be a complete, consistent specification that combines the information presented in the version 2.0 documents (below) with the contents of the 1.1 version
